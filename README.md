## 🎓 Course Reviews, By Students, For Students

A dedicated platform helping university students make informed course enrollment decisions through comprehensive, student-driven course reviews and ratings.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Have you ever signed up for a class only to realize halfway through the semester that it was not what you expected? Too much work, not enough clarity, or completely different from what you needed?

**The Current Challenge:**
- Students rely on word of mouth or RateMyProfessors to gauge classes
- Existing platforms focus on **professors**, not the **course experience**
- Limited information about workload, difficulty, and actual course content
- No centralized platform for course-specific feedback

This leads to poor course selection, unnecessary stress, and wasted time on classes that don't align with students' academic or career goals.

Unlike RateMyProfessors, we focus on:
- ✅ **Course workload** and time commitment
