CLASSIFY — FRONTEND DOCUMENTATION
Version 1.0
Author: Sid Rajesh
Description: CLASSIFY is a retro-styled course browsing and review platform

1. Overview

CLASSIFY is a browser-based frontend application designed to:

- Display university course departments as interactive cards

- Allow keyword and course-code searching (Spotlight Search)

- Open modals showing course lists, course details, and professor-specific reviews

- Allow users to submit course reviews

- Provide an animated, retro pixel-art aesthetic

- All course data is fetched from the backend via: GET /api/courses


The frontend is entirely dynamic (JavaScript-driven) and uses modals, live search, and generated DOM elements to build the UI.
